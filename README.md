# 🎓 Student Exam Performance Indicator

> An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts a student's **Math Score** based on demographic and academic input factors — deployed on both **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** and **Azure App Service** with a full **CI/CD pipeline** via GitHub Actions.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a student's background information (gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score), predict their **Math Score** (0–100).

This is a **supervised regression** problem solved using multiple ML algorithms with automated hyperparameter tuning and the best model is selected automatically.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Ingestion (`data_ingestion.py`)
- Reads the raw student CSV dataset
- Performs an 80/20 random train-test split (`random_state=42`)
- Saves `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `data.csv` under `artifacts/`

### 2. Data Transformation (`data_transformation.py`)
Builds a **scikit-learn `ColumnTransformer`** with two sub-pipelines:

| Feature Type | Columns | Transformations |
|---|---|---|
| **Numerical** | `reading_score`, `writing_score` | `SimpleImputer(median)` → `StandardScaler` |
| **Categorical** | `gender`, `race_ethnicity`, `parental_level_of_education`, `lunch`, `test_preparation_course` | `SimpleImputer(most_frequent)` → `OneHotEncoder` → `StandardScaler` |

The fitted preprocessor object is serialized to `artifacts/preprocessor.pkl`.

### 3. Model Training (`model_trainer.py`)
Seven regression models are trained and evaluated with **GridSearchCV (3-fold CV)**:

| Model | Key Hyperparameters Tuned |
|---|---|
| Linear Regression | — |
| Decision Tree Regressor | `criterion` |
| Random Forest Regressor | `n_estimators` |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `subsample` |
| XGBoost Regressor | `n_estimators`, `learning_rate` |
| CatBoost Regressor | `depth`, `learning_rate`, `iterations` |
| AdaBoost Regressor | `n_estimators`, `learning_rate` |

- The model with the **highest R² score** on the test set is saved to `artifacts/model.pkl`
- A minimum R² threshold of **0.6** is enforced; otherwise an exception is raised

### 4. Prediction Pipeline (`predict_pipeline.py`)
- Loads `model.pkl` and `preprocessor.pkl` from `artifacts/`
- Accepts a `CustomData` object (one student's inputs) as a Pandas DataFrame
- Returns the predicted math score

## 🌐 Web Application

Built with **Flask**, the app exposes two routes:

| Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | Landing / home page |
| `/predictdata` | GET | Renders the prediction form |
| `/predictdata` | POST | Accepts form input, runs prediction, displays result |

**Input fields on the form:**
- Gender (Male / Female)
- Race / Ethnicity (Group A – E)
- Parental Level of Education (6 categories)
- Lunch Type (Standard / Free-Reduced)
- Test Preparation Course (None / Completed)
- Reading Score (0–100)
- Writing Score (0–100)

**Output:** Predicted Math Score

## ⚙️ Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aaadityasngh/End-To-End-Machine-Learning-Project-with-AWS-Azure-Deployment.git
cd End-To-End-Machine-Learning-Project-with-AWS-Azure-Deployment

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies (also installs the src package in editable mode)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model

```bash
python src/components/data_ingestion.py
```

This will:
1. Read `notebook/data/stud.csv`
2. Split into train/test and save under `artifacts/`
3. Build and apply the preprocessing pipeline, saving `artifacts/preprocessor.pkl`
4. Train all 7 models with hyperparameter tuning
5. Save the best model to `artifacts/model.pkl`
6. Print the best model's R² score

### Running the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## ☁️ Deployment

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

The `.ebextensions/python.config` sets the WSGI entry point:

```yaml
option_settings:
  "aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python":
    WSGIPath: application:application
```

Deploy using the AWS EB CLI:
```bash
eb init -p python-3.7 mlproject
eb create mlproject-env
eb deploy
```

### Azure App Service (CI/CD via GitHub Actions)

The workflow `.github/workflows/main_studentssperformance3.yml` automatically:
1. **Builds** the app (sets up Python 3.7, installs requirements)
2. **Packages** and uploads the artifact
3. **Deploys** to Azure App Service (`studentssperformance3`) on every push to `main`

Set the `AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE` secret in your GitHub repository settings to enable automatic deployments.

## 📈 Key Engineering Decisions

- **Modular design**: Each ML stage (ingestion, transformation, training) is a standalone, reusable Python class — making it easy to swap components independently.
- **Custom exception handling**: Detailed error messages include the file name and line number, making debugging straightforward.
- **Automated model selection**: All 7 models are evaluated automatically; the best one is saved without manual intervention.
- **Serialized artifacts**: Both the preprocessing pipeline and the model are persisted as `.pkl` files, ensuring the prediction pipeline uses exactly the same transformations as training.
- **Dual-cloud deployment**: The app is deployable on both AWS and Azure, demonstrating cloud-agnostic design.

---

## 🔧 Project Setup Details

The project is packaged via `setup.py`, making the `src/` directory importable as the `mlproject` package across the entire codebase (the `-e .` in `requirements.txt` achieves this).
